 # Product Requirements Document: MCP Server Marketplace

## 1. Problem/Opportunity
The MCP (Model-Client-Protocol) server ecosystem is currently fragmented with limited discoverability, validation, and installation options. Users face challenges finding quality servers, while creators lack standardized distribution channels and monetization options. The awesome-mcp-servers GitHub repository (https://github.com/punkpeye/awesome-mcp-servers) serves as the most comprehensive collection but lacks user-friendly discovery, quality validation, and seamless installation across multiple IDEs.

## 2. Target Users & Use Cases

### Student Developer
- **Use Case**: Discover and install free educational MCP servers with minimal setup effort and clear documentation.
- **Pain Points**: Limited budget, overwhelmed by configuration options.

### Professional Developer
- **Use Case**: Find specialized, high-quality servers that enhance productivity and integrate with existing workflows.
- **Pain Points**: Wasted time configuring tools, unreliable servers, lack of consistent experience across IDEs.

### Enterprise Architect
- **Use Case**: Discover and deploy secure, enterprise-ready MCP servers that comply with company policies.
- **Pain Points**: Security concerns, governance limitations, lack of compliance features.

### AI Server Creator
- **Use Case**: Distribute specialized MCP servers, gather usage analytics, and monetize premium features.
- **Pain Points**: Limited distribution channels, no revenue options, difficulty tracking adoption.

## 3. Current Landscape
The awesome-mcp-servers GitHub repository serves as the current primary catalog for MCP servers, but presents these limitations:
- Raw GitHub interface not optimized for discovery
- No quality metrics or validation
- Manual installation process
- No user ratings or reviews
- Limited filtering and categorization
- No real-time status monitoring

Existing marketplaces like Smithery.ai, MCP.so, and PulseMCP offer partial solutions but lack comprehensive features and cross-IDE compatibility.

## 4. Proposed Solution
MCP Server Marketplace: An IDE-agnostic platform for discovering, installing, and managing quality-assured MCP servers, with real-time synchronization with the awesome-mcp-servers GitHub repository.

### Value Propositions:
1. **Universal IDE Integration**: One-click installation across Cursor, VS Code, and JetBrains IDEs
2. **Quality Assurance**: Automated validation, security scanning, and community ratings
3. **Smart Discovery**: AI-powered contextual recommendations based on user behavior and project context
