   - Browser extension and IDE plugins for VS Code, Cursor, JetBrains
   - Standardized configuration format that works across environments
   - API for third-party IDE integration

2. **Intelligent Server Discovery**
   - Contextual recommendations based on open projects/files
   - AI-powered search that understands developer intent
   - Categorization by use case, not just technology

3. **Quality Assurance**
   - Automated validation of submitted servers
   - Security scanning and code review
   - Performance benchmarking
   - Uptime monitoring for remote servers

4. **Simplified Configuration**
   - Visual configuration builder with dependency management
   - Environment variable management with secure storage
   - Configuration templates for common use cases

5. **Monetization Options for Creators**
   - Free and premium server tiers
   - Usage-based analytics
