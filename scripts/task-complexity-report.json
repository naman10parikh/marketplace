    {
      "taskId": 1,
      "taskTitle": "Set up project infrastructure and base architecture",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the setup of a Node.js/Express project with TypeScript into subtasks including directory structure, linting/formatting, testing, Git/CI/CD, Docker, environment configs, error handling, and logging.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves multiple foundational activities, each with its own best practices and potential pitfalls. Setting up infrastructure requires coordination between tooling, environment configuration, and code structure, which increases complexity. Mistakes here can propagate throughout the project, so careful breakdown is essential."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 2,
      "taskTitle": "Implement authentication and user management",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "List subtasks for building a secure authentication system with JWT, signup/login/logout endpoints, email verification, password reset, role-based access, and error handling.",
      "reasoning": "Authentication is security-critical and must handle various flows (signup, login, password reset, role checks) securely. It interacts with user data, cookies, and middleware, and requires robust error handling. Industry standards demand careful implementation to avoid vulnerabilities."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Create data models and database setup",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the process of designing schemas, setting up Postgres, creating models, implementing migrations, building a data access layer, and CRUD operations.",
      "reasoning": "Database design and implementation underpin the entire system. This task requires careful schema planning, migration management, and efficient data access patterns. Mistakes can lead to data integrity issues or performance bottlenecks."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Build data ingestion service",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of a service for ingesting data from GitHub webhooks and user submissions, including webhook handling, validation, parsing, async processing, nightly sync, and approval workflow.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves integrating with external systems (GitHub), handling asynchronous processing, validating complex schemas, and managing approval workflows. Each component introduces potential failure points and requires robust error handling and security checks."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Implement vector search with Pinecone",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "List subtasks for setting up Pinecone, embedding generation, batch and real-time indexing, search API, filtering, ranking, and pagination.",
      "reasoning": "Integrating semantic search with a vector database involves multiple moving parts: embedding pipelines, indexing strategies, API design, and ranking algorithms. Ensuring performance and relevance adds to the complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 6,
      "taskTitle": "Develop core Web UI components",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the creation of a React-based UI into subtasks for project setup, core pages, reusable components, routing, authentication UI, search results, and error/loading states.",
      "reasoning": "Building a modern, responsive UI with authentication, search, and detail pages requires careful component design, state management, and integration with backend APIs. Accessibility and responsiveness add further complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Create server submission and survey functionality",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "List subtasks for implementing server submission forms, validation, approval workflow, survey UI, API endpoints, authorization, dashboards, and notifications.",
      "reasoning": "This task combines form validation, workflow management, user feedback, and notification systems. Ensuring a smooth and secure user experience across these flows requires careful breakdown and testing."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Develop IDE plugins",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the development of IDE plugins for VS Code, Cursor, and Windsurf, covering commands, UI panels, authentication, shared libraries, and deep link handling.",
      "reasoning": "Developing cross-IDE plugins involves understanding different extension APIs, implementing shared logic, handling authentication, and ensuring seamless integration with the main system. Each IDE has unique requirements, increasing overall complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "Implement analytics tracking and dashboard",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "List subtasks for event tracking, data aggregation, dashboard UI, analytics APIs, export functionality, and access control.",
      "reasoning": "While analytics systems are well-understood, integrating event tracking, aggregation, and secure dashboarding still requires careful planning to ensure accuracy, performance, and security."

      "taskTitle": "Deploy, test, and optimize the system",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down deployment and optimization into subtasks for production setup, security hardening, performance tuning, monitoring, documentation, feature flags, and disaster recovery.",
      "reasoning": "This task encompasses deployment, security, performance, monitoring, and documentation. Each area is critical for production readiness and requires specialized expertise. The breadth and depth of activities make this the most complex task."
