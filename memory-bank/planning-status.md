## Project Complexity Assessment

This project has been assessed as **Level 3 (High Complexity)** due to:

- Multi-platform integration requirements (VS Code, Cursor, JetBrains)
- Complex security needs for server validation
- Sophisticated recommendation system
- Performance and scalability requirements
- Enterprise-grade features planned for later phases

## Next Steps

### 1. Creative Phase

Before implementation begins, the following creative design work must be completed:

- **UI/UX Design System**
  - Finalize brand identity (colors, typography, iconography)
  - Create component library design specifications
  - Design responsive layouts for key pages
  - Develop dark/light mode variations

- **API Architecture**
  - Finalize REST API endpoint structure
  - Document authentication and authorization flow
  - Define pagination, filtering, and error handling patterns
  - Complete SDK architecture design

- **Security Model**
  - Finalize RBAC permission matrix
  - Detail server validation pipeline
  - Document security implementation approach
  - Design secure API key management

- **Recommendation Algorithm**
  - Complete data collection plan
  - Design algorithm architecture
  - Define personalization strategy
  - Plan A/B testing approach

### 2. Implementation Phase

After creative design is complete, implementation should follow this sequence:

1. **Foundation (MVP) - Phase 1**
   - Project setup and architecture
   - Core backend services
   - Web portal UI
   - MVP IDE integration
   - Quality assurance system

2. **Enhancement - Phase 2**
   - Advanced search and discovery
   - Analytics platform
   - Server management tools
   - Additional IDE support

3. **Enterprise and Monetization - Phase 3**
   - Subscription and payment system
   - Enterprise features
   - Performance optimization
   - Community and documentation

## Team Requirements

Based on project complexity and scope, the recommended team structure is:

- 1× Project Manager
- 2× Frontend Developers (React/Next.js)
- 2× Backend Developers (Node.js/TypeScript)
- 1× DevOps Engineer
- 1× Designer (UI/UX)
- 1× QA Engineer
- 1× Security Specialist (part-time)

## Timeline Estimate

- **Creative Phase**: 2-3 weeks
- **Phase 1 (MVP)**: 2-3 months
- **Phase 2**: 2-3 months
- **Phase 3**: 3-4 months

Total estimated duration: 7-10 months to complete all phases.

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Cross-IDE compatibility challenges | High | Medium | Create abstraction layer, extensive testing |
| Server validation security issues | High | Medium | Sandbox isolation, security expert review |
| Performance with large server catalog | Medium | Medium | Implement caching, pagination, optimization |
| User adoption barriers | High | Medium | Focus on seamless onboarding, documentation |
| Integration with IDE marketplaces | Medium | High | Early partnership discussions, fallback plans |

## Next Actions

1. Present plan to stakeholders for approval
2. Assemble the team for the creative phase
3. Set up development infrastructure (repository, CI/CD, environments)
4. Begin creative design work
5. Create detailed project schedule
