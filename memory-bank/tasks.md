## Immediate Next Actions
1. Set up repository with initial project structure
2. Configure development environment with Docker
3. Define database schema with Prisma
4. Create preliminary API documentation with OpenAPI
5. Begin implementation of authentication service

## Creative Phase Requirements
- Design system and UI/UX patterns (before task 3)
- API architecture design (before task 2)
- Recommendation algorithm design (before task 6)
- Security model architecture (before task 2)

## Technical Considerations
- Ensure all components adhere to the architectural patterns defined in systemPatterns.md
- Follow the constraints and requirements outlined in techContext.md
- Implement a robust security model with defense-in-depth approach
- Develop with cross-IDE compatibility as a primary consideration
- Design for future scalability with clean separation of concerns
