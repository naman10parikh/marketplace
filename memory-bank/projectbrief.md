# Project Brief: MCP Server Marketplace

## Project Overview
Creating an IDE-agnostic marketplace for MCP (Model-Client-Protocol) servers that focuses on quality over quantity, with seamless integration across multiple IDEs, analytics-driven discovery, and community feedback systems.

## Core Value Proposition
- **Quality over quantity**: Curated, validated MCP servers
- **Seamless integration**: One-click installation across multiple IDEs (Cursor, VS Code, JetBrains)
- **Analytics-driven discovery**: Recommend servers based on usage patterns and project context
- **Community feedback**: Ratings, reviews, and usage metrics

## Key Features
1. **Universal IDE Integration**
   - Browser extension and IDE plugins for VS Code, Cursor, JetBrains
   - Standardized configuration format that works across environments
   - API for third-party IDE integration

2. **Intelligent Server Discovery**
   - Contextual recommendations based on open projects/files
   - AI-powered search that understands developer intent
   - Categorization by use case, not just technology

3. **Quality Assurance**
   - Automated validation of submitted servers
   - Security scanning and code review
   - Performance benchmarking
   - Uptime monitoring for remote servers

4. **Simplified Configuration**
   - Visual configuration builder with dependency management
   - Environment variable management with secure storage
   - Configuration templates for common use cases

5. **Monetization Options for Creators**
   - Free and premium server tiers
   - Usage-based analytics
   - Revenue sharing for premium servers
   - Enterprise licensing options

## Business Model
1. **Freemium Approach**
   - Free tier for discovering and using open-source servers
   - Premium subscription for advanced features
   
2. **Enterprise Offering**
   - Private marketplace instances
   - Compliance and security controls
   - Custom server development

3. **Developer Ecosystem**
   - Revenue sharing for premium server developers (70/30 split)
   - Developer tools and SDKs for creating high-quality servers
   - Certification program for professional server developers

## Technical Implementation Overview
- Cloud-based registry with distributed edge caching
- Containerized server validation and testing
- Real-time server health monitoring
- API-first architecture for extensibility
- Multiple IDE plugins (VS Code, Cursor, JetBrains)
- Web-based configuration portal

## Initial Launch Strategy
- Target Cursor and VS Code users first (largest MCP adoption)
- Launch with 50-100 high-quality, curated servers
- Partner with key AI tool developers
- Engage with open-source MCP community
