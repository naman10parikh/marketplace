# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Analytics System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a system to track and display installation metrics and search usage.
# Details:
1. Design analytics schema in PostgreSQL or DynamoDB
2. Implement event tracking for:
   - search_performed (session ID, query)
   - server_installed (server ID, timestamp)
3. Create API endpoints to:
   - Record analytics events
   - Retrieve aggregated metrics
4. Implement a background job to update install_count for each server
5. Add basic dashboard view for admins
6. Implement data retention policies
7. Add anonymization for privacy compliance
8. Create charts for installation trends

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify event recording with test events
2. Validate aggregation logic for metrics
3. Test concurrent event handling
4. Verify dashboard data accuracy
5. Load test with simulated high volume of events

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and implement analytics data schema [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the database schema to store analytics events and aggregated metrics
### Details:
Design and implement a schema in PostgreSQL with the following tables: 1) events table with columns for event_type, timestamp, session_id, server_id, and a JSON field for event-specific data; 2) daily_metrics table for pre-aggregated data with columns for date, metric_name, and metric_value; 3) servers table with installation data. Include appropriate indexes on timestamp, event_type, and server_id fields. Add partitioning by date for the events table to improve query performance and facilitate data retention policies.

## 2. Implement event tracking and API endpoints [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Create API endpoints to record analytics events and retrieve metrics
### Details:
Implement REST API endpoints: 1) POST /api/analytics/events to record events like search_performed and server_installed with appropriate validation; 2) GET /api/analytics/metrics to retrieve aggregated metrics with filtering options by date range and metric type. Implement middleware to capture and store search events automatically. Add rate limiting to prevent abuse. Include proper error handling and logging. Ensure all endpoints are properly authenticated and authorized.

## 3. Create background processing for metrics aggregation [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.2
### Description: Implement background jobs to process raw events into aggregated metrics
### Details:
Create a scheduled background job using a task queue (like Celery) that runs hourly to process raw events into the daily_metrics table. Implement aggregation functions for: total searches, unique searches, installation count, active servers, and user engagement metrics. Add a separate daily job to update the install_count for each server. Include error handling, retry logic, and monitoring for these background jobs. Implement a mechanism to backfill historical data if needed.

## 4. Build admin dashboard with visualization components [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2, 6.3
### Description: Create a dashboard UI for administrators to view analytics data
### Details:
Implement an admin dashboard page with: 1) Overview section showing key metrics; 2) Installation trends chart using a charting library like Chart.js; 3) Search usage statistics with filtering options; 4) Server activity heatmap. Make all charts interactive with date range selectors. Ensure the dashboard is responsive and performs well with large datasets by implementing pagination and lazy loading. Add export functionality for reports in CSV format.

## 5. Implement data retention and privacy compliance features [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3
### Description: Add data retention policies and privacy compliance features
### Details:
Implement a data retention policy that automatically archives events older than 90 days to cold storage and purges data older than 1 year. Create an anonymization process that removes or hashes personally identifiable information in the analytics data. Add configuration options for admins to adjust retention periods. Implement a privacy compliance report that shows what data is being collected and stored. Create a data purging API endpoint that allows for manual deletion of specific data points when needed for GDPR compliance.
