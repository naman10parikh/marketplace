# Task ID: 1
# Title: Set up project infrastructure and base architecture
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the project structure, configure development environment, and set up the foundational architecture for the MCP Server Marketplace.
# Details:
Create a Node.js/Express project with TypeScript. Set up the directory structure following best practices (routes, controllers, services, models). Configure ESLint, Prettier, and testing framework (Jest). Initialize Git repository with CI/CD pipeline configuration. Set up Docker for local development. Create configuration files for different environments (dev, test, prod). Implement basic error handling middleware and logging.

# Test Strategy:
Verify project structure and configuration. Run linting and basic tests to ensure the setup is working correctly. Test the CI/CD pipeline with a simple build.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Initialize Node.js/Express project with TypeScript [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the base Node.js project with Express framework and TypeScript configuration
### Details:
Create a new directory for the project. Initialize npm with 'npm init'. Install core dependencies: express, typescript, ts-node, @types/node, @types/express. Create tsconfig.json with appropriate compiler options (target: es6, module: commonjs, outDir: dist, rootDir: src, strict: true). Create a basic server.ts file with Express initialization. Set up npm scripts for development and building (start, build, dev).

## 2. Establish project directory structure and Git repository [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Create the directory structure following best practices and initialize Git with proper configuration
### Details:
Create the following directory structure: src/{routes, controllers, services, models, middleware, utils, config}. Add README.md with project overview. Initialize Git repository with 'git init'. Create .gitignore file (include node_modules, dist, .env files, logs). Create initial commit with base structure. Set up GitHub/GitLab repository and push initial commit. Create development branch for ongoing work.

## 3. Configure code quality tools and testing framework [done]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Set up ESLint, Prettier, and Jest for code quality and testing
### Details:
Install ESLint, Prettier and related dependencies. Create .eslintrc.js with TypeScript configuration. Create .prettierrc with team's code style preferences. Set up lint and format npm scripts. Install Jest, ts-jest, @types/jest, and supertest for API testing. Configure Jest in jest.config.js for TypeScript support. Create a basic test file to verify the setup. Add test and test:watch npm scripts.

## 4. Implement environment configuration system [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Create configuration files for different environments and implement a configuration management system
### Details:
Install dotenv package. Create .env.example file with required variables. Create src/config/index.ts to load and validate environment variables. Implement configuration objects for different environments (development, test, production). Add environment-specific validation rules. Create a configuration service that provides access to the current environment configuration. Document required environment variables in README.md.

## 5. Set up Docker for local development [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.4
### Description: Create Docker and Docker Compose configuration for local development environment
### Details:
Create Dockerfile for the application with appropriate Node.js base image. Set up multi-stage build process for development and production. Create docker-compose.yml with application service and any required dependencies (database, cache, etc.). Configure volume mapping for hot-reloading in development. Set up environment variable passing from .env to containers. Add Docker-specific npm scripts (docker:build, docker:up, docker:down). Document Docker usage in README.md.

## 6. Implement error handling and logging middleware [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.4
### Description: Create middleware for consistent error handling and logging throughout the application
### Details:
Install logging library (winston or pino). Create src/middleware/logger.ts for application logging. Implement different log levels based on environment. Create src/middleware/errorHandler.ts for centralized error handling. Implement custom error classes in src/utils/errors.ts. Create middleware for catching async errors. Implement request ID tracking for request tracing. Add middleware to the Express application in server.ts. Create basic health check endpoint at /health.
