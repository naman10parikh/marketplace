# Task ID: 5
# Title: Build Web UI for Search and Browse
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a React-based web interface for searching, browsing, and installing MCP servers.
# Details:
1. Set up React project with Tailwind CSS
2. Create components for:
   - Search bar with type-ahead suggestions
   - Filter controls (tags, version, sort options)
   - Server card displaying metadata
   - Detail view/modal showing full README
   - Install button and confirmation
3. Implement search functionality with debouncing
4. Add responsive design for mobile and desktop
5. Implement client-side caching
6. Add loading states and error handling
7. Implement analytics tracking for user interactions
8. Create install flow with code snippet generation

# Test Strategy:
1. Component unit tests with React Testing Library
2. Integration tests for search and filter functionality
3. User testing for UI/UX feedback
4. Cross-browser compatibility testing
5. Accessibility testing (WCAG compliance)

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up React project with component structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Initialize React project with Tailwind CSS and create the basic component architecture for the search and browse interface
### Details:
1. Create a new React project using Create React App or Vite
2. Install and configure Tailwind CSS
3. Set up folder structure (components, hooks, utils, etc.)
4. Create skeleton components for main layout, search bar, filter controls, server card, and detail view
5. Implement basic routing between main views
6. Set up state management approach (Context API or Redux)

## 2. Implement search and filter functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Build the search bar with type-ahead suggestions and implement filter controls for refining search results
### Details:
1. Create search bar component with input field and suggestion dropdown
2. Implement debounced search functionality to prevent excessive API calls
3. Build filter components for tags, versions, and other metadata
4. Create sort controls (popularity, date, etc.)
5. Implement client-side filtering logic
6. Add loading states during search operations
7. Handle empty states and error scenarios

## 3. Develop server listing and detail views [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Create the server card components for the browse view and detailed server information modal/page
### Details:
1. Design and implement server card component showing key metadata (name, description, tags, popularity)
2. Create grid/list layout for displaying multiple server cards
3. Implement pagination or infinite scroll for browsing many results
4. Build detailed server view showing full README content
5. Add syntax highlighting for code blocks in README
6. Implement responsive design for both card and detail views
7. Add animations for transitions between views

## 4. Build installation flow with code snippet generation [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.3
### Description: Create the installation process UI with generated code snippets for users to copy
### Details:
1. Design and implement install button on server cards and detail view
2. Create installation confirmation modal with options
3. Implement code snippet generation based on selected options
4. Add copy-to-clipboard functionality for code snippets
5. Create visual feedback for successful copy operations
6. Implement installation tracking for analytics
7. Add helpful tooltips and documentation links

## 5. Implement performance optimizations and final polish [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2, 5.3, 5.4
### Description: Add client-side caching, performance improvements, and final UI polish
### Details:
1. Implement client-side caching of search results and server details
2. Add analytics tracking for key user interactions
3. Optimize component rendering with React.memo or useMemo where appropriate
4. Implement skeleton loaders for improved perceived performance
5. Add error boundary components to prevent UI crashes
6. Conduct cross-browser testing and fix any compatibility issues
7. Perform accessibility audit and implement necessary improvements
