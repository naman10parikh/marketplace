# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement vector search with Pinecone
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Set up RAG-driven semantic search over manifests and READMEs using Pinecone vector database.
# Details:
Set up Pinecone client and configuration. Create service to convert manifest and README text into embeddings. Implement batch indexing for initial data load. Create real-time indexing for new or updated servers. Build search API with natural language query support. Implement filtering by tags, version, recency, and popularity. Create ranking algorithm combining semantic similarity and install count. Add pagination and result limiting.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for embedding generation and search service. Integration tests with Pinecone test instance. Performance tests for search latency. Verify search result quality with predefined queries.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up Pinecone client and configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Initialize the Pinecone client with proper configuration and create the vector index for storing embeddings
### Details:
Create a service that initializes the Pinecone client with API keys from environment variables. Configure the vector dimensions (e.g., 768 or 1536 depending on the embedding model). Set up proper error handling and connection pooling. Create a vector index with appropriate settings for similarity metric (cosine, dot product, or euclidean) and metadata filtering capabilities. Include configuration for dev/prod environments.

## 2. Implement embedding generation service [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Create a service to convert manifest and README text into vector embeddings
### Details:
Implement a service that takes text from manifests and READMEs and converts it into vector embeddings. Use an appropriate embedding model (e.g., OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 or an open-source alternative). Handle text chunking for long documents with appropriate overlap. Implement caching to avoid regenerating embeddings for unchanged content. Create utility functions for text preprocessing (removing markdown syntax, code blocks handling, etc.).

## 3. Implement batch indexing for initial data load [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2
### Description: Create a batch process to index all existing manifests and READMEs
### Details:
Develop a batch indexing process that retrieves all existing manifests and READMEs, generates embeddings for them, and uploads them to Pinecone in batches. Implement progress tracking and error handling with retry logic. Optimize for performance with parallel processing where appropriate. Store metadata with each vector including server ID, version, tags, install count, and last updated timestamp. Create a command-line interface to trigger reindexing when needed.

## 4. Implement real-time indexing for new or updated content [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2, 5.3
### Description: Create a service to automatically index new or updated manifests and READMEs
### Details:
Implement event listeners or hooks that trigger when manifests or READMEs are created or updated. Create a service that generates embeddings for the new/updated content and upserts them into Pinecone. Implement deduplication logic to avoid duplicate entries. Add logging for indexing operations. Create a mechanism to handle deletions by removing corresponding vectors from the index.

## 5. Build search API with natural language query support [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.3, 5.4
### Description: Create an API endpoint that accepts natural language queries and returns relevant results
### Details:
Implement a REST API endpoint that accepts natural language queries. Convert queries to embeddings using the same embedding model. Query the Pinecone index with the embedding to find semantically similar content. Implement filtering capabilities by tags, version, recency, and popularity using Pinecone's metadata filtering. Create a ranking algorithm that combines semantic similarity scores with install count/popularity. Add pagination support with customizable page size. Include result limiting options.

## 6. Implement search results enhancement and testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.5
### Description: Enhance search results with additional metadata and implement comprehensive testing
### Details:
Enrich search results with additional metadata from the original documents. Implement result highlighting to show where matches occurred. Create a comprehensive test suite with unit tests for each component and integration tests for the entire search pipeline. Develop a set of benchmark queries to evaluate search quality. Implement monitoring for search performance and relevance. Create documentation for the search API including examples and best practices.
