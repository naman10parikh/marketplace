# Task ID: 4
# Title: Build data ingestion service
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the service to ingest MCP server data from GitHub webhooks and user submissions.
# Details:
Create GitHub webhook endpoint to receive repository updates. Implement webhook secret validation for security. Build service to fetch and parse manifest files and READMEs from repositories. Create nightly sync job to ensure data consistency. Implement queue system for processing ingestion tasks asynchronously. Add validation for manifest schema according to Appendix A. Create service to handle user submissions with validation and approval workflow.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for webhook handler and manifest parser. Integration tests with mock GitHub payloads. Test validation logic for manifests. Verify nightly sync job with test repositories.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create GitHub webhook endpoint [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement the API endpoint to receive GitHub webhook events for repository updates
### Details:
Create a REST API endpoint that accepts POST requests from GitHub webhooks. The endpoint should parse the incoming payload to identify the repository and event type (push, release, etc.). Implement basic request validation to ensure the payload contains the required fields. Set up proper error handling and logging for debugging purposes. The endpoint should return appropriate HTTP status codes (200 for success, 400 for invalid requests).

## 2. Implement webhook security validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Add security validation for GitHub webhooks using webhook secrets
### Details:
Enhance the webhook endpoint to validate the X-Hub-Signature header using the webhook secret. Store the webhook secret securely in environment variables or a secrets manager. Implement the HMAC-SHA256 signature verification algorithm to validate that requests are coming from GitHub. Reject requests with invalid signatures with a 401 Unauthorized response. Add detailed logging for security events including failed validation attempts.

## 3. Build queue system for asynchronous processing [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.2
### Description: Implement a queue system to handle ingestion tasks asynchronously
### Details:
Set up a message queue system (e.g., RabbitMQ, AWS SQS, or Redis) to handle ingestion tasks asynchronously. Create producer code that adds tasks to the queue when webhook events are received. Implement consumer workers that process tasks from the queue. Add retry logic for failed tasks with exponential backoff. Implement dead-letter queue for tasks that repeatedly fail. Include monitoring and alerting for queue health and processing delays.

## 4. Implement manifest and README fetching service [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.3
### Description: Create service to fetch and parse manifest files and READMEs from GitHub repositories
### Details:
Implement a service that uses the GitHub API to fetch manifest files and READMEs from repositories. Use GitHub's content API to retrieve raw file content. Parse the manifest files according to the expected format. Extract relevant metadata from README files. Handle rate limiting from GitHub API by implementing appropriate backoff strategies. Cache repository data to minimize API calls. Implement error handling for missing files or invalid content.

## 5. Add manifest schema validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.4
### Description: Implement validation for manifest schema according to Appendix A
### Details:
Create a schema validator for manifest files based on the specifications in Appendix A. Use a schema validation library (like JSON Schema) to define and enforce the manifest structure. Implement custom validation rules for fields with specific requirements. Create detailed error messages for validation failures to help users correct their manifests. Add unit tests for the validator with both valid and invalid manifest examples. Document the schema requirements for developers.

## 6. Create user submission service [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.5
### Description: Build service to handle user submissions with validation and approval workflow
### Details:
Implement a service for users to submit new MCP server data. Create API endpoints for submission, status checking, and updates. Reuse the manifest validator from subtask 5 to validate submissions. Implement an approval workflow with states (submitted, under review, approved, rejected). Create an admin interface for reviewing and approving submissions. Send notifications to users about submission status changes. Store submission history and audit logs for compliance purposes.

## 7. Implement nightly sync job [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.4, 4.5
### Description: Create a scheduled job to ensure data consistency by syncing with GitHub repositories
### Details:
Develop a scheduled job that runs nightly to sync all tracked repositories. Implement logic to detect and process changes since the last sync. Reuse the manifest fetching and validation services from previous subtasks. Add comprehensive logging for sync operations. Implement error handling and alerting for sync failures. Create a dashboard to monitor sync status and history. Ensure the job can be manually triggered for immediate syncing when needed. Add configuration options for sync frequency and depth.
