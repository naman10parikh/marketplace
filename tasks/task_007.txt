### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Create backend API endpoints to handle server submissions with proper authentication and data validation
### Details:
Develop RESTful API endpoints for creating, reading, and updating server submissions. Implement server-side validation of submission data and manifest structure. Create database models for storing submission data with status field (pending/approved/rejected). Add authentication middleware to ensure only logged-in users can submit. Include rate limiting to prevent abuse. Document the API endpoints for frontend integration.

## 3. Build submission workflow and status dashboard [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2

### Description: Develop a survey interface for collecting user feedback about servers with ratings and comments
### Details:
Design and implement a modal component for surveys that can be triggered from server details pages. Include a star rating system (1-5 stars) with clear visual feedback. Add text fields for collecting detailed comments and feedback. Implement client-side validation to ensure required fields are completed. Create a responsive design that works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## 5. Implement API endpoints for survey data [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.4
### Description: Create backend API endpoints to handle survey submissions with authentication and data validation
### Details:
Develop RESTful API endpoints for creating and retrieving survey data. Implement server-side validation of survey inputs. Create database models for storing survey responses with relationships to users and servers. Add authentication checks to ensure only authenticated users can submit surveys. Implement logic to prevent duplicate surveys from the same user for the same server. Add aggregation endpoints to calculate average ratings and compile feedback.

## 6. Build notification system for submission status changes [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.3, 7.5
### Description: Create a notification system to alert users about changes to their submission status
### Details:
Implement a notification service that monitors submission status changes. Create database models for storing notification data. Develop a notification center UI component to display recent notifications to users. Add real-time notifications using WebSockets or a similar technology. Implement email notifications for important status changes. Create preference settings to allow users to configure notification preferences.
