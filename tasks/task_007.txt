# Task ID: 7
# Title: Develop VS Code Extension
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a VS Code extension for searching and installing MCP servers directly from the IDE.
# Details:
1. Set up VS Code extension project (TypeScript)
2. Implement side panel UI with search box and results list
3. Create commands for mcp.search and mcp.install
4. Implement workspace detection and mcp.json handling
5. Add functionality to:
   - Search servers using the API
   - Display results in the side panel
   - Install selected server by updating mcp.json
   - Inject code snippets into active file if requested
6. Add configuration options for the extension
7. Implement telemetry for usage tracking
8. Create documentation and help resources

# Test Strategy:
1. Manual testing in VS Code
2. Extension API tests
3. Test installation flow with various project structures
4. Verify mcp.json creation and updating
5. Test code snippet injection in different file types

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up VS Code extension project structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Initialize the VS Code extension project with TypeScript and establish the basic scaffolding needed for development.
### Details:
1. Install Node.js and npm if not already installed
2. Install Yeoman and VS Code Extension Generator: `npm install -g yo generator-code`
3. Generate extension scaffold: `yo code`
4. Configure TypeScript settings in tsconfig.json
5. Set up extension manifest (package.json) with basic metadata, activation events, and commands
6. Create initial folder structure (src/, resources/, etc.)
7. Set up testing framework with basic tests
8. Ensure the extension can be launched in debug mode

## 2. Implement side panel UI and basic commands [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Create the extension's user interface with a side panel containing search functionality and implement the core commands.
### Details:
1. Create a WebviewPanel or TreeView for the side panel UI
2. Design and implement the search box and results list UI using HTML/CSS
3. Register the commands `mcp.search` and `mcp.install` in package.json
4. Implement command handlers in extension.ts
5. Set up communication between the webview and extension host
6. Create icons and other visual assets for the extension
7. Implement basic state management for the panel
8. Add keyboard shortcuts for the commands

## 3. Implement MCP API integration and search functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2
### Description: Connect to the MCP API to enable server searching and display results in the side panel.
### Details:
1. Create a service class to handle API communication
2. Implement the search functionality to query the MCP API
3. Parse and format search results for display
4. Add error handling for API requests
5. Implement pagination or infinite scrolling for search results
6. Add filtering options for search results
7. Create data models for server information
8. Implement caching for recent searches to improve performance

## 4. Implement workspace detection and server installation [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.3
### Description: Add functionality to detect the current workspace, handle mcp.json files, and install selected servers.
### Details:
1. Implement workspace detection to find project root
2. Create utilities to read and write mcp.json files
3. Implement the server installation process
4. Add validation for compatibility with the current project
5. Create progress indicators for installation process
6. Implement error handling for installation failures
7. Add support for different project types
8. Create notification system for installation events

## 5. Add configuration, code snippets, and documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.4
### Description: Implement extension configuration options, code snippet injection, telemetry, and create documentation.
### Details:
1. Add configuration options in package.json
2. Implement settings UI in the extension
3. Create code snippet templates for different languages
4. Implement snippet injection into active files
5. Add telemetry for tracking extension usage (with opt-out option)
6. Write comprehensive README.md with installation and usage instructions
7. Create additional documentation (changelog, contributing guide)
8. Add contextual help within the extension UI
9. Package the extension for publishing to VS Code Marketplace
