# Task ID: 8
# Title: Develop Cursor and Windsurf IDE Integrations
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create integrations for Cursor and Windsurf IDEs to provide similar functionality as the VS Code extension.
# Details:
1. Research Cursor and Windsurf SDK/API capabilities
2. Implement pane UI for each IDE following their design patterns
3. Reuse core search and install logic from VS Code extension
4. Adapt the UI to match each IDE's style guidelines
5. Implement IDE-specific features as needed
6. Create consistent user experience across all IDEs
7. Add telemetry for usage tracking
8. Test compatibility with different IDE versions

# Test Strategy:
1. Manual testing in each IDE
2. Verify feature parity with VS Code extension
3. Test installation flow in each IDE
4. Collect user feedback from early adopters
5. Test with different project types and configurations

# Subtasks:
## 1. Research and document Cursor and Windsurf IDE extension APIs [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Investigate the extension development capabilities of both Cursor and Windsurf IDEs, documenting their APIs, extension points, and limitations compared to VS Code.
### Details:
Create a comprehensive document covering: extension initialization process, UI component APIs, command registration, settings management, and extension packaging for both IDEs. Identify which VS Code extension APIs have direct equivalents and which will require custom implementations. Document any IDE-specific features that could enhance the integration. Include code snippets showing basic extension structure for each IDE.

## 2. Create core architecture for cross-IDE compatibility [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Design and implement a modular architecture that allows sharing core functionality while accommodating IDE-specific implementations.
### Details:
Develop an abstraction layer that separates the core search and install logic from IDE-specific UI implementations. Create interface definitions for UI components, commands, and settings that each IDE implementation will need to fulfill. Refactor the existing VS Code extension to fit this new architecture. Implement a factory pattern to instantiate the appropriate implementation based on the detected IDE. Document the architecture with diagrams showing the component relationships and data flow.

## 3. Implement Cursor IDE integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Build the extension for Cursor IDE using their extension API and following their design patterns.
### Details:
Implement the UI components for Cursor IDE, including the search pane, results display, and package details view. Adapt the VS Code extension's styling to match Cursor's design guidelines. Register commands and keyboard shortcuts according to Cursor's conventions. Implement Cursor-specific features identified during research. Create the extension manifest and packaging configuration for Cursor. Test the implementation on multiple versions of Cursor IDE.

## 4. Implement Windsurf IDE integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Build the extension for Windsurf IDE using their extension API and following their design patterns.
### Details:
Implement the UI components for Windsurf IDE, including the search pane, results display, and package details view. Adapt the VS Code extension's styling to match Windsurf's design guidelines. Register commands and keyboard shortcuts according to Windsurf's conventions. Implement Windsurf-specific features identified during research. Create the extension manifest and packaging configuration for Windsurf. Test the implementation on multiple versions of Windsurf IDE.

## 5. Implement cross-IDE telemetry and analytics [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.3, 8.4
### Description: Create a unified telemetry system that works across all IDE integrations while respecting each platform's privacy guidelines.
### Details:
Design a telemetry data model that captures important usage metrics (searches, installations, errors) consistently across all IDEs. Implement IDE-specific telemetry adapters that conform to each platform's best practices. Add telemetry collection points throughout the shared codebase. Create a dashboard for visualizing usage across different IDEs. Ensure all telemetry collection includes appropriate opt-out mechanisms and complies with privacy regulations. Document what data is collected and how it's used.

## 6. Perform cross-IDE testing and release preparation [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.3, 8.4, 8.5
### Description: Conduct comprehensive testing across all IDE platforms and prepare for coordinated release.
### Details:
Create a test plan covering all features across the three IDE platforms. Implement automated tests where possible. Conduct manual testing on different OS platforms and IDE versions. Create unified documentation that highlights any platform-specific differences. Prepare release packages for each IDE's extension marketplace. Create release notes and update documentation. Implement a coordinated release strategy to launch all extensions within the same timeframe. Set up monitoring for post-release issues.
