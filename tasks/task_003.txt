# Task ID: 3
# Title: Create data models and database setup
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Design and implement the database schema for users, servers, events, and surveys as specified in the PRD.
# Details:
Set up Postgres database with proper schemas. Create models for users, servers, events, and surveys following the data model in section 7. Implement database migrations for schema changes. Set up database connection pooling and error handling. Create data access layer with repositories/services for each model. Implement basic CRUD operations for all entities. Add indexes for frequently queried fields.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for models and repositories. Integration tests with test database. Performance tests for common queries. Verify data integrity constraints and relationships.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design database schema and entity relationships [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create comprehensive database schema diagrams for users, servers, events, and surveys based on section 7 of the PRD.
### Details:
Create entity-relationship diagrams (ERDs) showing all tables, columns, data types, primary/foreign keys, and relationships between entities. Define constraints, indexes, and normalization approach. Document schema decisions including handling of user roles, server memberships, event scheduling, and survey responses. Prepare for review before implementation.

## 2. Set up Postgres database and connection configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Initialize Postgres database instance and configure connection settings with proper security and performance parameters.
### Details:
Create a new Postgres database instance. Configure environment variables for database credentials. Implement connection pooling with appropriate pool size settings. Set up error handling and connection retry logic. Create database users with proper permission scopes. Configure SSL for secure connections. Document connection string format and configuration options.

## 3. Implement database migration system [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.2
### Description: Set up a migration framework to manage schema changes and version control for the database.
### Details:
Select and integrate a migration tool (like Flyway, Liquibase, or Knex). Create initial migration scripts for schema creation. Implement up/down migration capabilities. Set up migration versioning strategy. Create CI/CD integration for automated migrations. Document migration commands and procedures for development and production environments.

## 4. Create data models and ORM mappings [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.3
### Description: Implement data model classes for all entities with proper ORM mappings to the database tables.
### Details:
Create model classes for users, servers, events, and surveys. Implement ORM mappings between models and database tables. Define relationships between models (one-to-many, many-to-many). Add validation rules and constraints. Implement type conversions and serialization methods. Create unit tests for model behavior. Document model properties and relationships.

## 5. Implement repository layer for data access [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.4
### Description: Create repository classes that provide data access methods for each entity type.
### Details:
Create repository interfaces and implementations for each entity type. Implement CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). Add specialized query methods for common access patterns. Implement transaction management. Add pagination support for list operations. Create proper error handling and logging. Write unit tests for repository methods. Document repository API and usage patterns.

## 6. Optimize database performance with indexes and query tuning [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.5
### Description: Add database indexes for frequently queried fields and optimize common query patterns.
### Details:
Identify frequently queried fields from application requirements. Create appropriate indexes for these fields. Implement composite indexes for multi-column queries. Add full-text search indexes if needed. Optimize join queries with proper indexes. Measure and document query performance. Create index maintenance strategy. Update migration scripts to include index creation. Document indexing strategy and performance considerations.
