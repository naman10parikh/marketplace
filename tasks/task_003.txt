# Task ID: 3
# Title: Set up Pinecone Vector Database for RAG Search
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement vector embeddings and Pinecone integration for semantic search capabilities.
# Details:
1. Set up a Pinecone account and create an index with appropriate dimensions
2. Implement a service to generate embeddings from server README content and metadata
3. Create a batch process to index all existing servers
4. Implement real-time indexing for new/updated servers
5. Create a search service that:
   - Converts search queries to embeddings
   - Performs vector similarity search in Pinecone
   - Combines results with metadata filters (tags, version)
   - Ranks results by semantic similarity and install_count
6. Implement caching for frequent queries
7. Add monitoring for index health and query performance

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify embedding quality with sample README content
2. Test search relevance with various query types
3. Benchmark search latency (target < 300ms)
4. Test filtering and sorting functionality
5. Validate index updates when server metadata changes

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up Pinecone account and index configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a Pinecone account, set up API access, and configure an index with appropriate dimensions for the embedding model
### Details:
1. Sign up for a Pinecone account
2. Create an API key with appropriate permissions
3. Select an embedding model (e.g., OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 with 1536 dimensions)
4. Create a Pinecone index with matching dimensions
5. Configure the index with appropriate metric (cosine similarity)
6. Store credentials securely in environment variables
7. Create a configuration module to manage Pinecone connection settings

## 2. Implement embedding generation service [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Create a service that converts server README content and metadata into vector embeddings
### Details:
1. Implement a text preprocessing function to clean and normalize README content
2. Create a function to chunk large README files into appropriate sizes
3. Integrate with an embedding model API (e.g., OpenAI, Hugging Face)
4. Implement error handling and retry logic for embedding generation
5. Create a function to combine embeddings with server metadata
6. Add logging for embedding generation process
7. Implement rate limiting to avoid API throttling

## 3. Develop batch indexing process for existing servers [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2
### Description: Create a batch process to generate embeddings and index all existing servers in Pinecone
### Details:
1. Create a function to retrieve all existing servers from the database
2. Implement a batch processing system with appropriate chunking
3. Add progress tracking and reporting
4. Implement error handling with failed item tracking
5. Create a retry mechanism for failed items
6. Add validation to ensure all servers are properly indexed
7. Implement a command-line interface to trigger batch indexing

## 4. Implement real-time indexing for new/updated servers [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.2, 3.3
### Description: Create a system to automatically index new servers and update existing server embeddings when content changes
### Details:
1. Implement event listeners for server creation and update events
2. Create a function to determine if content has changed significantly enough to require re-indexing
3. Implement a queue system for processing indexing requests
4. Add logic to update existing vectors rather than creating duplicates
5. Implement deletion of vectors when servers are removed
6. Add error handling and notification for failed indexing
7. Create a manual trigger to force re-indexing of specific servers

## 5. Create vector search service with ranking [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.3, 3.4
### Description: Implement a search service that converts queries to embeddings, performs vector similarity search, and ranks results
### Details:
1. Create a function to convert search queries to embeddings
2. Implement Pinecone query interface with appropriate parameters
3. Add support for metadata filtering (tags, version)
4. Implement hybrid ranking that combines semantic similarity with install_count
5. Create a scoring function to normalize and weight different ranking factors
6. Add pagination support for search results
7. Implement search result formatting and enrichment with additional metadata

## 6. Add caching, monitoring and performance optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.5
### Description: Implement caching for frequent queries and add monitoring for index health and query performance
### Details:
1. Implement a caching layer for frequent queries using Redis or similar
2. Create cache invalidation strategies based on index updates
3. Add performance metrics collection for query latency
4. Implement monitoring for index health (size, update frequency)
5. Create dashboards for search performance and usage patterns
6. Add alerting for performance degradation or errors
7. Implement query optimization techniques based on performance data
