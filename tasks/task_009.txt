# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement analytics tracking and dashboard
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 6, 7
# Priority: low
# Description: Create the system for tracking events and displaying analytics data for administrators.
# Details:
Implement event tracking for search_performed, server_installed, server_submitted, and survey_completed. Create data aggregation service for metrics calculation. Build admin dashboard UI with charts and filters. Implement server-specific analytics on detail pages. Create API endpoints for analytics data. Add export functionality for reports. Implement access control to ensure only admins can view full analytics.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for event tracking and aggregation. Integration tests for dashboard data loading. Verify metrics calculations with test data. Test access control for admin-only views. Performance testing for analytics queries.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement event tracking system [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a client and server-side event tracking system to capture user interactions
### Details:
Implement a tracking service that captures the required events (search_performed, server_installed, server_submitted, survey_completed). The service should handle both client-side events via JavaScript and server-side events via API calls. Each event should include relevant metadata (timestamp, user ID if available, event-specific data). Implement a queue system to handle high volumes and ensure events aren't lost during network issues. Add appropriate logging and error handling.

## 2. Create analytics data storage and aggregation service [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Develop the backend service for storing events and calculating aggregated metrics
### Details:
Design and implement the database schema for storing tracked events. Create a service that processes incoming events, stores them in the database, and performs real-time and/or batch aggregation for common metrics (e.g., daily/weekly/monthly counts, conversion rates, user engagement metrics). Implement data retention policies and optimization for query performance. The service should provide methods for querying both raw events and pre-aggregated metrics.

## 3. Develop API endpoints for analytics data [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.2
### Description: Create secure REST API endpoints that serve analytics data to the dashboard
### Details:
Implement RESTful API endpoints that provide access to both raw events and aggregated metrics. Include filtering capabilities (by date range, event type, etc.), pagination for large result sets, and sorting options. Implement access control middleware to ensure only authenticated administrators can access these endpoints. Add rate limiting to prevent abuse. Create endpoints for data export functionality in common formats (CSV, JSON).

## 4. Build admin dashboard UI with charts and filters [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.3
### Description: Create the frontend interface for administrators to view and interact with analytics data
### Details:
Develop a responsive dashboard UI with multiple views for different analytics perspectives. Implement interactive charts and graphs using a library like Chart.js or D3.js. Add filtering controls for date ranges, event types, and other relevant dimensions. Create a tabular data view with sorting and filtering capabilities. Implement the export functionality UI that connects to the API endpoints. Ensure the UI is responsive and works well on different screen sizes.

## 5. Implement server-specific analytics and access control [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.3, 9.4
### Description: Add detailed analytics for individual servers and finalize access control system
### Details:
Extend the analytics system to provide detailed metrics for individual server detail pages. Implement role-based access control to ensure administrators can view all analytics while regular users can only see limited data relevant to their servers. Add unit and integration tests for the entire analytics system. Create documentation for administrators on how to use the dashboard and interpret the data. Perform security review and performance optimization of the entire analytics system.
