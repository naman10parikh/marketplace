# Task ID: 10
# Title: Deploy, test, and optimize the system
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
# Priority: low
# Description: Finalize the application, deploy to production, and perform comprehensive testing and optimization.
# Details:
Set up production environment with proper scaling. Configure HTTPS and security headers. Implement rate limiting and DDoS protection. Perform security audit and fix vulnerabilities. Optimize database queries and add caching where appropriate. Conduct load testing and performance optimization. Create monitoring and alerting system. Write documentation for API and user guides. Implement feature flags for gradual rollout. Create backup and disaster recovery procedures.

# Test Strategy:
End-to-end testing of all user flows. Security penetration testing. Load testing to verify scalability requirements. Performance testing for latency requirements. Verify monitoring and alerting systems. User acceptance testing with stakeholders.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up production environment with security configurations [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Prepare the production infrastructure with proper scaling capabilities, HTTPS, and security headers
### Details:
Configure cloud infrastructure (AWS/GCP/Azure) with auto-scaling groups. Set up load balancers and configure HTTPS with proper SSL certificates. Implement security headers (Content-Security-Policy, X-XSS-Protection, etc.). Create separate environments for staging and production. Document the infrastructure setup with diagrams and access procedures.

## 2. Implement protection mechanisms and security audit [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Add rate limiting, DDoS protection, and perform a comprehensive security audit
### Details:
Implement rate limiting at the API gateway level. Set up DDoS protection using cloud provider tools or services like Cloudflare. Conduct a thorough security audit including penetration testing, code review for security vulnerabilities, and dependency scanning. Document all findings and create a prioritized list of security issues to address.

## 3. Optimize database and implement caching [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Improve database performance and add appropriate caching mechanisms
### Details:
Analyze and optimize database queries using explain plans. Add indexes where needed. Implement query caching for frequently accessed data. Set up Redis or Memcached for application-level caching. Create a caching strategy document that outlines what data is cached, invalidation rules, and TTL values. Monitor query performance before and after optimizations.

## 4. Conduct load testing and performance optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2, 10.3
### Description: Test system under load and optimize performance bottlenecks
### Details:
Create load testing scenarios using tools like JMeter or Locust. Simulate expected peak traffic and identify bottlenecks. Optimize application code, server configurations, and resource allocation based on test results. Implement front-end performance improvements (asset compression, lazy loading, etc.). Document performance benchmarks and improvements.

## 5. Implement monitoring, alerting, and logging [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.4
### Description: Set up comprehensive monitoring systems with appropriate alerting thresholds
### Details:
Implement application performance monitoring (APM) using tools like New Relic, Datadog, or Prometheus/Grafana. Set up log aggregation with ELK stack or similar. Configure alerts for critical metrics (error rates, latency, resource utilization). Create dashboards for key performance indicators. Document incident response procedures and on-call rotations.

## 6. Create backup and disaster recovery procedures [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.5
### Description: Implement and test backup systems and disaster recovery plans
### Details:
Set up automated database backups with appropriate retention policies. Implement file/asset backups. Create disaster recovery procedures including database restoration, application redeployment, and data recovery. Test the disaster recovery process in a staging environment. Document recovery time objectives (RTO) and recovery point objectives (RPO). Create runbooks for common recovery scenarios.

## 7. Finalize documentation and implement feature flags [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.6
### Description: Create comprehensive documentation and set up feature flags for gradual rollout
### Details:
Implement feature flag system using a service like LaunchDarkly or a custom solution. Create API documentation with Swagger/OpenAPI. Write user guides and admin documentation. Document system architecture, data flows, and integration points. Create a rollout plan for new features using the feature flag system. Set up a knowledge base for support team and end users.
